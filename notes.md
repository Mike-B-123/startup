Can use these contents for midterm and final exam!

I learned from this assignment how to set up Github and how to commit and push between Github and my laptop!
make sure to cd into the right directory first!
To save to git hub on terminal: git add .
then: git commit -m "commit message here"
finally: git push

To Deploy when the deploy file is not in the same file as the pem key do the following:
** One problem I run into is getting into the grandparent file to acess my pem Key**
** To fix this put ../../key.pem which tells it, that it is two folders above**
1. use this command in the terminal "./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup" (or simon instead of startup)
2. Also make sure to use the Go live extenstion to text your code as you go instead of using just code pen (after every go live you will need to close the 500 port)
